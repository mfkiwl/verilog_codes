//
// The following instructions describe how to prepare Vivado to use the XPM libraries:
// 1. Ensure Vivado can identify the XPMs:
//    Flow 1: Using the Vivado IDE and/or Project Flow
//            When using the IDE and/or the project flow, you do not need to take any additional steps.
//            The tools will parse the files added to the project and setup Vivado to recognize the XPMs
//    Flow 2: Using the non-Project based flow
//            When using the non-project flow, the following command must be issued:
//            auto_detect_xpm
//
// 2. Select the XPM template that you wish to use from below
// 3. Copy the contents of the template and paste into your own source file.
//    Set parameters/generics, and wire ports according to the documentation provided as code comments.
//
// Note: Be sure to read and comply with all code comments to properly use the XPMs.
