i2s2 pmod info

adc data:
    sigle speed: 4 to 54 KHz
    double speed: 86 to 108 KHz
dac data:
    2 to 200KHz    

interface:
    mclk:
    lrck: is word select.. left or right sample in the stereo
    sclk: bit clock

dac derives it own sclk if you give it two consecutives frames
of the lrck without any sclk. To do that the dac measure the 
ratio between mclk and lrck. The posible ratio are:
    
    16-bit and sck=32*fs if mclk/lrck = 1024,512,256,128, 64
    24-bit and sck=48*fs if mclk/lrck = 768, 384,192, 96
    24-bit and sck=72*fs if mclk(lrck = 1152
this ratios also determine the working mode used by the dac

adc:
it has 2 modes: slave where sclk and lrck are generated by the
host.
    mlck/lrck   sclk/lrck   input sample(khz)
    256x        64          4-24, 43-54
    512x        64          43-54
    384x        64          4-24, 43-54
    784x        64          43-54
    128x        64          86-108
    256x        64          86-108
    192x        64          86-108
    384x        64          86-108

In master mode lrck and sclk are generated by the adc, you need
to feed the mclk in the range 4-54KHz, then the adc derives the
lrck and sclk taking the ratio 256x/512x dependig on the mclk freq
