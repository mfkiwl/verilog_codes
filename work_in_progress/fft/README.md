There are several ways to implementate an DFT, here I listed some:

- [ ] Typical radix 2
- [ ] Typical radix 4
- [ ] Biplex FFT
- [ ] Bluestein FFT

- [ ] SDFT
- [ ] Goertzel DFT
- [ ] mSDFT


Here I listed some references to look at:
- Lawrence R. Rabiner, Bernard Gold - Theory and Application of Digital Signal Processing.
- Oppenheim A. - Discrete-Time signal processing. 
- Lyons R. - Understanding Digital Signal Processing.
- Orallo C. - Single bin sliding discrete Fourier transform.
