# IF calibrator

This module correct RF devices that use as working principle a given balanced architecture where the S parameters should had a given relation. As the RF system usually have construction differences, the system always had imbalances that reduce the performance. 
This module is composed by first a correlator where the S parameters are measured, allowing the computation of correction constants to obtain the given S parameter solving the issue.
