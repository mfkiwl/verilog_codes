- The SDA only changes when scl is low
- start condition: h-l transition on sda while scl is high
- stop condition: l-h transition on sda while scl is high
- if instead stop you issue start again is a repeated start condition
- data is 8 bits long
- after each byte it has to be followed by an ack bit
- to ack the master should drive scl and free sda, to ack the slave has to
    pull down sda
- if the slave doesnt ack the master could issue stop condition to abort 
    or a repeted start condition
    
-after the start condition, the master send a 7bit address+ rw process 
    (0:write, 1:read) 

- the usual write packet should be:
    start-dev addr-w - ack - reg addr - ack -data -ack ...-data-ack-stop 

-the usual read packet:
    start-dev addr-w - ack - reg addr - ack -start - reg addr-r -ack- data-nack-stop
